# Realtime Crime Detection and Prediction Analysis

## About the Project
The Realtime Crime Detection and Prediction Analysis project is an innovative application that aims to detect and predict crime activities in real-time using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. This project leverages multiple technologies to provide accurate and timely insights into crime patterns, helping law enforcement agencies and communities to take proactive measures.

## Features
- **Realtime Detection:** Utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect crime activities in real-time from video feeds.
- **Crime Prediction:** Analyzes historical crime data to predict future crime hotspots and trends.
- **Data Visualization:** Presents crime data and predictions through intuitive visualizations for better understanding and decision-making.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers a web-based interface for users to interact with the system and access insights.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS:** For styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript:** For adding interactivity to the web pages.
- **Python:** For backend processing, including data analysis and machine learning.
